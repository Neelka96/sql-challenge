## Introduction  
It’s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company).  
My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s  
and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.  

For this project, I have to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files  
into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, I'll perform data modeling, data  
engineering, and data analysis, respectively.  


## Challenge Overview  
This challenge is interesting in that the most difficult part was the overall Schema creation and data  
modeling. While the querying was interesting, it didn't challenge my thinking the same was the schema  
creation did, and likely because by doing that work I saved myself a lot of trouble when querying.  

Through the completion of this challenge, I learned how strongly good data modeling depends on context.  
Understanding how the data was decided to be inputted, whether more data will ever come in, and how  
the relationships were envision when the data was originally written. Deciding whether those factors  
are important and should be retained, whether they are erroneous/irrelevant, and what can be changed  
to enhance database efficiency is what was truly challenging for me.

## Setup and Usage  
### Prerequisites & Instructions  
- Written in | **SQL:2023 (ISO/IEC 9075:2023)**  
- DBMS used | **PostgreSQL 17.2**  

1. Install PostgreSQL if not already done (ensure version is compatible with *17.2*)  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Create DataBase sql-challenge_db if it doesn't exist  
4. Connection to DataBase should be automatic, create a new `query tool window` or session  
5. Run the `schema.sql` file in a query window to setup/restart tables  
6. Import CSV Files from `sql-challenge_db/EmployeeSQL/data` directory into the corresponding tables  
7. Open the `queries.sql` file in a query window and run block-by-block (be sure to start with the `SET datestyle = 'Postgres, MDY';` line)
